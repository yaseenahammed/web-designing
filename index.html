        <p class="text-center mt-4 text-muted px-4">
            Drugs don’t just harm your body — they destroy your brain, your dreams, and your future. They weaken your ability to think clearly, damage relationships, and can lead to irreversible mental and physical health problems. Every dose pulls you further away from the person you were meant to become. Choose life, choose clarity — say no to drugs.
            Drug addiction can destroy lives — leading to physical deterioration, broken families, mental health issues, and even death. By understanding the harsh realities, we empower ourselves and others to choose a healthier, brighter path.

      Over time, they impair your brain’s ability to function properly, causing memory loss, poor decision-making, and a lack of control. They tear apart relationships and lead to emotional and physical devastation. The long-term effects can be irreversible, often leading to death or permanent damage. Drugs take away your future — choose health, choose life, and say no to drugs.

  <p class="text-center mt-4 text-muted px-4">True happiness is found in genuine connections with others, not in the fleeting highs of drugs. Drugs may offer temporary escape, but they only rob you of meaningful relationships and the joy of living authentically. When you choose to live drug-free, you open the door to a life filled with real moments and real people who support and care for you. The bonds you form with friends and family, based on trust, love, and shared experiences, are the foundation of lasting happiness. By stepping away from drugs, you regain control of your mind, body, and spirit, creating space for genuine laughter, growth, and the kind of joy that comes only from healthy relationships. Choose life, choose connection, and embrace the happiness that comes from being truly present with those who matter most.

          <p>Drugs destroy lives, families, and communities. Saying no is the first step to freedom. Saying no to drugs is a crucial step toward protecting your health and future. Drugs can damage your brain, impair judgment, and lead to addiction. Over time, they weaken relationships and contribute to a cycle of pain and suffering. By refusing drugs, you choose a path of mental clarity, personal growth, and a positive future. Don’t let temporary escape steal your long-term potential. Say no to drugs for a healthier, happier life.</p>

Every obstacle is an opportunity to grow and prove your inner strength. Keep moving forward, trust in your abilities, and remember that you have the power to overcome whatever comes your way.</p>
